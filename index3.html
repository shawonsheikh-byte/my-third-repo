        <p>Article 53 of the Basic Law stipulates that a new Chief Executive shall be selected within six months in accordance with the provisions of Article 45 of this Law. Interpretation of the term of the Chief Executive became a part of a legal dispute in 2005 after the resignation of then-Hong Kong Chief Executive, Tung Chee-Hwa. The question arose as to whether his successor would serve a full five-year term or would only serve the remainder of Tung's term. Those who supported him for a full five-year term, which included much of the Hong Kong legal community, argued that this is the literal reading of the article. But those who argued for a partial term argued that a partial term was the clear legislative intent of the article, as filling a partial term is the practice within the People's Republic of China.[citation needed]</p>
